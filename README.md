# 🧠 SkinDx AI – Skin Lesion Risk Classifier

**SkinDx AI** is an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to classify skin lesions as *benign* or *malignant*, designed to support triage and early risk detection in dermatology. It also includes a public Gradio-based app that allows real-time user interaction.

## 🔍 Dataset

> Skin lesion images with metadata from ISIC or similar public datasets.  
The images were pre-labeled as **benign** or **malignant**, and were resized to `224x224`.

📌 Note: The dataset is not included in the repo due to size and licensing. You can integrate your own by following instructions in the notebook.

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Data augmentation + class weighting significantly improve generalization on small imbalanced datasets.
- Pretrained models (MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) require fine-tuning to outperform custom CNNs.
- Validation accuracy > training accuracy is not necessarily overfitting if dropout and augmentation are applied only during training.
- Combining image and tabular signals helps, but only marginally in this dataset.

---

## 🚧 To Do

- Add Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability
- Experiment with fine-tuning pretrained backbones (e.g., unfreeze MobileNet layers)
- Try more advanced ensembling (e.g., stacking with cross-validation)
